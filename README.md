# MayaStandaloneBatchTest

This is a test of batch execution of a script on multiple maya files using maya standalone.
This sample test contains a script file "mayaTest.py" that creates several spheres at random points on the scene.
"mayaBatch.py" opens all the .ma files in a specified location and runs the above mentioned script and save/closes the files.

These scripts can be used as template for performing more complex and repetitive tasks without physically opening multiple maya files and running the script.
